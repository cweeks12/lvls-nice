# Lvls? Nice.
This plugin gives us the feedback we want when we brag about our levels. 

Install this plugin to get a sweet "nice" from every player around you when using the `!lvl` command, 
or just typing a number between 1 and 99.

Optionally set the responses, separated by commas, that you would like to see on the config pane.
